### Hi there 👋

I'm an long-time software engineer, with experience in open source work, startups, and the enterprise. Focused on ruby and the backend lately, but still full-stack.

🏳️‍🌈 I'm non-binary.

⚓️ I live in Providence, RI.

I'm learning to tune pianos!

I make music 🎹, and [generative art](https://designischoice.com/). I'm an autodidact, and like to remember that "amateur" comes from the French for "one who loves."
