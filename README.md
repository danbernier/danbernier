### Hi there 👋

I'm an experienced software engineer, and a bit of a hack.

🏳️‍🌈 I'm non-binary.

⚓️ I live in Providence, RI.

I'm learning to tune pianos!

I make music 🎹, and [generative art](https://designischoice.com/). I'm an autodidact, and like to remember that "amateur" comes from the French for "one who loves."
